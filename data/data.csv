2,AI,"Great! Based on the context and plot of the movie, here's a potential survey question for the user:

""How did Vihaan's decision to leave his desk job and join the surgical strike mission affect you as a viewer?""

This question is designed to gauge the user's emotional response to Vihaan's actions in the movie, specifically how his decision to put himself in harm's way to avenge the death of his brother-in-law and other soldiers affected their overall viewing experience. The answer could be anything from a simple ""it made me feel sad"" to a more detailed analysis of how the scene contributed to the overall themes and emotions of the movie."

4,AI,"Sure, I can generate a movie survey question for you based on the given context or movie plot. Here is one possible survey question:

""What do you think would be the most challenging part of Vihaan's mission to avenge his brother-in-law's death in the surgical strike?""

This question is based on the context of the movie plot, where Vihaan is part of a special forces unit that is tasked with carrying out a surgical strike against the North-eastern terrorists who killed his brother-in-law. The question is designed to get the user's opinion on what would be the most difficult aspect of such a mission, and it allows the user to reflect on the movie plot and provide their own insights.

Please let me know if you want me to generate another survey question based on the same context or a different part of the movie plot."
